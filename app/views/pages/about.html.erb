<h1>Hi, I&rsquo;m Joe Flynn! I build intuitive interfaces.</h1> 
<p> 
	I am an analyst, developer, designer, musician, and an enthusiast of everything to	
	do with the web and the movement of information. My passion is user interface design and development		  
	with an eye towards readability, usability, and sound information architecture. I write CSS like it&rsquo;s my		  
	mother tongue.
	I&rsquo;m dedicated to the idea that one should never stop learning, and I&rsquo;m constantly looking
	to expand my horizons and my capabilities.
